<h2>Childhood</h2>
<p>I grew up in a family that valued curiosity and learning. From a young age, I loved observing people and asking questions about why they think and behave the way they do.</p>
<p>These early experiences shaped my love for psychology and understanding human behavior. I also enjoyed exploring, reading, and discovering new things about the world around me.</p>
